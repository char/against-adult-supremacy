- Markdown files are formatted using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
- `content/[date]` should be a directory of Markdown documents, all from an issue of NO! published on `date`.
- `content/[date]/[slug].md` should be an invidual essay.
- All essays should have consistently-structured front-matter:

```yml
title: This Essay Is Named Thusly
authors: ["Author Name"]
```

- ASCIIfication: In the interest of consistency across documents, we replace a few smart Unicode characters with their ASCII equivalents. This can be automatically undone by a smart Markdown renderer at a later time. **Note:** Do _not_ expect these documents to contain US-ASCII only.
